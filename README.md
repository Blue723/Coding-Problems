# README

These are some puzzles I come across on code wars. Might be some other sites added in the future. I am interested in data science so the languages the puzzles are in are eith Python, R, or SQL. I will be doing different type sof puzzles. I have no structure or order I want to do them in. 

Attempting and generally just thinking of manipulating data will improve me coding skills. I see many solutions for each problem, so that tells me there are many ways to solve a problem, but some are technically better.
